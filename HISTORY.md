# History

This repository is part of a broader effort to explore **AI-usable infrastructure**:
tools that are cheap, deterministic, and composable by autonomous systems.

The initial motivation came from observing that many agent ecosystems reward
discussion and personality, while under-investing in reusable artifacts.

This repository focuses exclusively on the latter.
